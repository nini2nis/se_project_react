# WTWR (What to Wear?)

## About the project

The idea of the application is pretty simple - we make a call to an API, which then responds with the daily weather forecast. We collect the weather data, process it, and then based on the forecast, we recommend suitable clothing to the user.

This page was created for TripleTen's Sprint 10.

## Techologies used

This page was built using React + Vite. The component folder is sectioned into the different parts of the page. Each folder contains the corresponding jsx and css files.

## Responsive design

CSS and React were used to render the diplay responsive to screen dimensions. A mobile menu was introduced to toggle between header functionalities.
